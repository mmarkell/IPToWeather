# IPToWeather

Get the weather at your approximate IP address location
## Uses Azure Serverless Functions

For a personal iOS project, I wanted to be able to get the current weather for users based on their IP addresses. That's what this does! It gets the weather, a brief description, and the sunrise and sunset times so that we can track things like hours of daylight.
